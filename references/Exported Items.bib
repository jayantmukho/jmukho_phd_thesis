	abstract = {A direct numerical simulation of a turbulent channel flow with a lower curved wall is performed at Reynolds number Reτ ≈ 600. Low-speed streak structures are extracted from the turbulent flow field using methods known as skeletonization in image processing. Individual streaks in the wall-normal plane averaged in time and superimposed to the mean streamwise velocity profile are used as basic states for a linear stability analysis. Instability modes are computed at positions along the lower and upper wall and the instability onset is shown to coincide with the strong production peaks of turbulent kinetic energy near the maximum of pressure gradient on both the curved and the flat walls. The instability modes are spanwise-symmetric (varicose) for the adverse pressure gradient streak base flows with wall-normal inflection points, when the total average of the detected streaks is considered. The size and shape of the counter-rotating streamwise vortices associated with the instability modes are shown to be reminiscent of the coherent vortices emerging from the streak skeletons in the direct numerical simulation. Conditional averages of streaks have also been computed and the distance of the streak's centre from the wall is shown to be an essential parameter. For the upper-wall weak pressure gradient flow, spanwise-antisymmetric (sinuous) instability modes become unstable when sets of highest streaks are considered, whereas varicose modes dominate for the streaks closest to the wall.},

	abstract = {A new approach to computational fluid dynamics code validation is developed that gives proper consideration to experimental and simulation uncertainties. The comparison error is defined as the difference between the data and simulation values and represents the combination of all errors. The validation uncertainly is defined as the combination of the uncertainties in the experimental data and the portion of the uncertainties in the CFD prediction that can be estimated. This validation uncertainty sets the level at which validation can be achieved. The criterion for validation is that the magnitude of the comparison error must be less than the validation uncertainty. If validation is not accomplished, the magnitude and sign of the comparison error can be used to improve the mathematical modeling. Consideration is given to validation procedures for a single code, multiple codes and/or models, and predictions of trends. Example results of verification/validation are presented for a single computational fluid dynamics code and for a comparison of multiple turbulence models. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed validation strategy. This new approach for validation should be useful in guiding future developments in computational fluid dynamics through validation studies and in the transition of computational fluid dynamics codes to design.},

	title = {Veriﬁcation and validation in computational ﬂuid dynamics},
	abstract = {Veriﬁcation and validation (V\&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V\&V in computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V\&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V\&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V\&V are addressed, such as code veriﬁcation versus solution veriﬁcation, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of veriﬁcation is the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of errors in the computational model and its solution. In veriﬁcation activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during veriﬁcation activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantiﬁed error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simpliﬁes the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V\&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V\&V in production and commercial software. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {This document presents guidelines for assessing the credibility of modeling and simulation in computational fluid dynamics. The two main principles that are necessary for assessing credibility are verification and validation. Verification is the process of determining if a computational simulation accurately represents the conceptual model, but no claim is made of the relationship of the simulation to the real world. Validation is the process of determining if a computational simulation represents the real world. This document defines a number of key terms, discusses fundamental concepts, and specifies general procedures for conducting verification and validation of computational fluid dynamics simulations. The document’s goal is to provide a foundation for the major issues and concepts in verification and validation. However, this document does not recommend standards in these areas because a number of important issues are not yet resolved. It is hoped that the guidelines will aid in the research, development, and use of computational fluid dynamics simulations by establishing common terminology and methodology for verification and validation. The terminology and methodology should also be useful in other engineering and science disciplines.},
