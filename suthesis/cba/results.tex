\section{Results} \label{sec:cba_results}
With the aircraft maneuver and flight simulation process defined, results from running the GTT aircraft through the flight certification maneuver are discussed in this section.
There are two over-arching goals of this work: first, to provide a framework that brings flight testing earlier in the aircraft design process, and second, to create the most accurate flight simulation results while minimizing the cost of the underlying analyses. 
To this end, this section first focuses on comparing simulations that are run using purely high-fidelity experimental data, to those run using low-fidelity and multi-fidelity data that would be available early in the design process.
Then the cost-reduction aspect is explored by harnessing the benefits of multi-fidelity databases that use small subsets of the high-fidelity data. 
For all the results in this section, simulations are conducted with the right engine inoperative, and all modifications discussed in Section \ref{subsec:sim_mods} are applied.

\subsection{Simulations using Single- vs. Multi-Fidelity Databases} \label{subsec:sf_vs_mf_cba}

In the nascent stages of the aircraft design, low-fidelity methods, such as AVL simulations, are used to perform rapid analyses that can span wide regions of the design domain quickly. 
These have higher uncertainties in their performance predictions due to simplifications made in modeling the flow physics, in favor of speed of analysis.
As parts of the aircraft design are fixed, higher-fidelity methods such as RANS CFD simulations are used to perform design optimizations.
These are computationally more expensive than AVL simulations, but also provide a more accurate representation of the aircraft's potential performance. 
Once designs are finalized, prototypes that can be experimentally tested in wind tunnels, are manufactured. 
These provide high-fidelity data that can recreate the expected flight conditions and have correspondingly low uncertainties associated with their performance predictions.
Finally, flight testing to certify the aircraft's air-worthiness is performed once all the design decisions are finalized and a full-sized prototype is manufactured.

Mimicking this sequence of design analyses, single- and multi-fidelity databases that use, in order, low-fidelity (AVL), low- + medium-fidelity (AVL + SU2), and low- + medium- + high-fidelity (AVL + SU2 + WT) data are created. 
An example of this build-up is presented in Section \ref{sec:data_gen}.
To bring aspects of the real-world flight testing procedure into the virtual environment where early design analyses are performed, flight simulations are carried out using these lower fidelity databases.
To assess the quality of the results, these are compared to flight simulations carried out using high-fidelity databases created using only the available wind tunnel data. 
It is important to note that while wind tunnel data has its own set of models that introduce errors when compared to flight tests, it is the highest-fidelity data available and is considered the truth function that is being emulated. 

It is important to remember that only basic aerodynamic coefficient data is available from SU2. 
This means that the two-fidelity results only use SU2 data for the force and moment coefficients in the aerodynamics database.
The controls databases for the two-fidelity results are actually only single-fidelity and are identical to the controls databases used for the AVL-only results. 
Consequently, the three-fidelity database is only truly three-fidelity for the force and moment coefficients; the rest are two-fidelity.
To avoid verbose explanations, the overall results are still referred to as two-fidelity when AVL+SU2 data is used, and three-fidelity when AVL+SU2+WT data is used.

With the details of the simulation procedure explained in Section \ref{sec:sim_procedure}, the results here will be presented primarily through the CDF plots of the success metrics resulting from the Monte Carlo analysis defined in \ref{subsec:mc_analysis}.
Figure \ref{fig:sf_vs_mf_metric_cdfs} presents the results of the flight simulations when lower fidelity databases are used.
