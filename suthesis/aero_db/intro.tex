At any point during flight, the air flow over the aircraft exerts certain aerodynamic forces and moments on the airframe. These are a function of the aircraft's geometry, orientation (angle of attack, angle of sideslip etc.), and operating conditions (dynamic pressure, mach number etc.). While designing the aircraft, calculating these forces and moments at various points in its operating envelope helps predict the aircraft's behavior and performance characteristics. Most aerodynamic analyses, be it computational or experimental, are geared towards creating a database that catalogs these values as a function of the aircraft's orientation and operating conditions.

The industry standard is to have a lookup-table that is populated by data from aerodynamic analyses that are performed during the design process. The forces and moments are described as multi-dimensional functions, depending on up to 5 input variables: angle of attack, sideslip angle, mach number, dynamic pressure, and Reynolds number. Discrete analyses in this 5-dimensional domain provide data points that are used interpolate values between analysis locations. These databases are deterministic and have no characterization of the uncertainties present in the analysis techniques, that might affect the data. 

Previous work by Wendorff et al. \cite{wendorff_combining_2016} introduces the concept of probabilistic aerodynamic databases that uses multi-fidelity data and its associated uncertainties in a Gaussian Process regression framework to create a non-deterministic representation of the database. Using a combination of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, an adaptive sampling technique was developed to find the best location to perform the next analysis to minimize the uncertainty in the objective function at minimum analysis cost. Its application was demonstrated using the NASA CRM configuration performing a longitudinal FAA certification maneuver. 

The current work further matures the probabilistic aerodynamic database concept. Comprehensive, multi-fidelity, multi-dimensional aerodynamics and controls databases are created for a full-configuration generic T-tail transport aircraft that define it's lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Uncertainties in analysis techniques are taken into account, with the CFD uncertainties provided by the eigenspace perturbation methodology introduced in Section \ref{sec:rans_uq}.
