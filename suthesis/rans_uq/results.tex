\section{Application to NASA CRM} \label{sec:crm_rans_uq}
Section \ref{sec:VandV_rans_uq} demonstrated the eigenspace perturbation methodology has been demonstrated on various test cases.
Here, the methodology is applied to a full-configuration aircraft.
The results in this section were first published in \cite{mukhopadhaya2020multi}  and are reproduced here.
The aircraft configuration is identical (without accounting for aeroelastic deflections of the model) to the one tested in the wind tunnel.
It closely resembles a Boeing 777 aircraft with a fully redesigned wing.
Table \ref{NASA_CRM_test_cond} describes the transonic simulation conditions.
Note that this range of angles of attack at a free-stream Mach number of 0.85 lead to non-linear physical phenomena and flow separation that can significantly increase the uncertainties in the RANS predictions.
Separated flow exists for $\alpha > 4^\circ$ at this Mach number.
All of the necessary RANS CFD simulations were conducted using the SU2~\cite{su2_aiaajournal} solver.
The SST turbulence model~\cite{sst,menter2003ten} was used and the previously defined perturbations, Equations \eqref{equ:eigenvalue_pert} - \eqref{equ:vmin_vmax}, were applied to it.

Figure \ref{fig:crm_mesh} shows details of the unstructured mesh used for the CFD simulations.
The computational domain consists of $11.8\times10^6$ mixed elements ($4.6\times10^6$ nodes), which corresponds to a coarse mesh based on the grid convergence studies performed for multiple solvers and grid topologies \cite{vassberg_summary_2010}.
Figure \ref{fig:dpw4_alpha_sweep} presents results of the angle-of-attack sweep study from SU2 on the coarse mesh alongside results from comparable unstructured solvers, BCFD \cite{winkler_dorgan_cary_mani_2009} and FUN3D \cite{lee-rausch_application_2014} on their medium-sized meshes.
The difference between the grid-converged drag at a fixed $C_L$ of 0.5 and the present study is $\approx4\%$; this difference can be used as a rough metric for the discretization error.
This error could be reduced through additional grid resolution studies, but it is not a primary factor for the present demonstration.

Figure \ref{fig:convergence_history} shows the convergence history for the simulations required to characterize the RANS uncertainty at a particular operating condition ($\alpha = 2.35^\circ$).
Most cases achieve six orders of magnitude reduction in the density residual.
For the $1C, v_{max}$ case, the residuals stall, but the solution is said to be converged once the force coefficients stabilize to six orders of magnitude (less than $10^{-6}$ change in force coefficients over $100$ non-linear iterations).

In Figure \ref{fig:crm_su2_uq}, the results of these simulations are compared to wind tunnel data from the NASA Ames 11ft Wind Tunnel experiment \cite{rivers_experimental_2010}.
In this figure, the solid black line represents the predictions made by the baseline SST turbulence model, the grey area represents the uncertainty estimates predicted by the eigenspace methodology, and the black crosses represent the wind tunnel data.
These wind tunnel data points have error bars associated with them, but these are barely discernible on the scale of the plot. 

The performance of the UQ module is illustrated by comparing the variation of the coefficients of lift ($C_L$), drag ($C_D$), and longitudinal pitching moment ($C_m$) due to the angle of attack ($\alpha$), as predicted by the CFD simulations to those experimentally determined.
We start with $C_L$ vs. $\alpha$ in Figure \ref{fig:cl_vs_alpha}.
At low angles of attack, the flow remains well attached to the aircraft body; therefore, the turbulence model does not introduce significant uncertainty in its predictions.
Accordingly, the interval bounds predicted by the UQ module are relatively small.
At higher angles of attack when there is flow separation over portions of the aircraft, turbulence models struggle to make accurate flow predictions due to the unsteady nature of the flow features and the structural limitations of the isotropic eddy viscosity enforced by the Boussinesq assumption.
The growing uncertainty estimates predicted by the module reflect this shortcoming.
All of the plots in Figure \ref{fig:crm_su2_uq} confirm this overall trend.

Figure~\ref{fig:cl_vs_cd} is a typical \emph{drag polar} plot for the NASA CRM at Mach 0.85.
This plot illustrates the paradigm change that RANS UQ methodologies such as the one described in this paper can bring about.
A drag polar is often used in aerospace engineering to understand an aircraft's behavior across its operating range at a given Mach number.
Design engineers use the deterministic values represented by the solid black line in the drag polar plot to determine the optimal operating condition for an aircraft and the aircraft performance characteristics.
Traditionally, only the solid black line is available to the aircraft designer, and they use conservative factors of safety to build operating margins into the design.
The grey areas representing the possible variability of the drag polar explicitly quantify the uncertainties injected by the turbulence model.
Instead of relying on a single deterministic value to design the aircraft around, the uncertainty in the performance prediction can inform the most robust optimal operating condition, and the reliability of the design choices can be quantified.

Since the model-form uncertainty introduced by the turbulence model is negligible at low angles of attack, the CFD predictions of the force and moment coefficients should adhere more closely to the experimental data.
Error in RANS CFD simulations can originate from multiple sources, including, but not limited to: discretization error due to insufficient mesh resolution, modeling error due to the turbulence models, or any errors due to geometric discrepancies in simulated and real-world objects.
If there were only turbulence-model-related uncertainties in the simulations, we would see all the experimental data points lie within the grey uncertainty bounds predicted by the RANS UQ methodology.
However,  we observe a significant deviation of the simulation data from the wind tunnel experiments.
This deviation manifests as a bias and a difference in the slope of the lift coefficient curve.
These differences are most prominent in the longitudinal pitching moment coefficient data in Figure \ref{fig:cm_vs_alpha}.
As was discovered at the 4th Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW) \cite{levy2013summary}, the wind tunnel model of the NASA CRM underwent aeroelastic deformation that affected the values recorded for the force and moment coefficients.
The deformations were more extensive than expected, and as a result, the shape of the model analyzed using numerical simulations was different from that of the wind tunnel model.
New computational geometries that accurately reflected the deformed wind tunnel shape were used for the subsequent workshop \cite{morrison20166th}.
For this work, we use the older computational geometry (without the wind-tunnel-induced deformations) to exercise the ability of the multi-fidelity method to learn biases existing in the data. 

On a swept wing like the one on the NASA CRM model, the added aeroelastic twist results in a decrease in the angle of attack of the wing-tip region relative to the numerically analyzed rigid shape.
This discrepancy leads to a lower $C_L$ than the one calculated using CFD.
Moreover, the increase in the overall twist of the wing unloads the wing-tip sections, effectively displacing the center of lift of the wing upstream and leading to the observed increased values of $C_M$ when compared to those calculated using CFD. 
These differences introduced new uncertainties (of an aeroelastic nature) in the numerical predictions that escape the UQ analysis.  

This discussion serves as an important reminder that regardless of the level of model (in)adequacy of a simulation method, there may be unforeseen uncertainties and errors introduced in the predictions that can cause results to deviate from real-world experiments.
In this particular case, the unexpected aeroelastic deformation of the CRM model in the wind tunnel resulted in slightly different geometries being numerically and experimentally analyzed.
The biases and errors introduced due to such unknowns are not explicitly derived here, but they are present in the data.
The auto-regressive formulation of the multi-fidelity GP will learn these biases and errors from the data.
If the high-fidelity data is truly the most accurate representation of the modeled physical system, it is good that the multi-fidelity GP can learn the bias between the lower-fidelity simulations and the high-fidelity data and compensate for it.
However, if there is an error in the high-fidelity data, the multi-fidelity GP will learn based on the erroneous data and still assume it to be the most accurate source. 
This observation highlights the importance of the hierarchy of data sources in this formulation.
This work employs a clearly defined hierarchy based on the physics captured by each information source.
Wind tunnel experiments form the highest fidelity level, followed by RANS CFD simulations, while vortex-lattice methods form the lowest fidelity level.
In general, the hierarchy could be defined based on the uncertainty of the predictions or expert-informed trust in the information source.

Another critical point is that the interval predictions from the RANS UQ methodology only estimate the uncertainty in simulations due to the turbulence model used.
The methodology cannot estimate other sources of error as it does not rely on any high-fidelity data.
For example, discretization error due to insufficient mesh quality can bias the performance predictions from CFD simulations. 
The RANS UQ methodology does not predict this bias.
Instead, we rely on the multi-fidelity GP framework to learn this and any other biases from the differences between the low- and high-fidelity data. 

A key observation from Figure \ref{fig:crm_su2_uq} is that the uncertainties are not symmetric about the baseline RANS simulation (the solid black line is not in the middle of the gray area).
As mentioned at the end of Section \ref{sec:equips_rans_uq}, these bounds contain no probability distribution information.
Nonetheless, for multi-fidelity modeling, it is assumed that the distribution of the QoIs within the bounds is Gaussian and symmetric about the middle of the interval.
Additionally, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the Gaussian distribution is defined such that the extents of the interval estimates are $2\sigma$ away from the middle of the interval.
This definition means that for any CFD data point with RANS UQ uncertainty estimate, the middle of the predicted interval is regarded as the mean of the Gaussian distribution of the prediction, and the extent of the interval bounds are $\pm 2\sigma$ away from the mean.

The RANS UQ methodology does not only provide interval estimates on integrated quantities like $C_L$, $C_D$, and $C_m$.
Since the eigenspace perturbations result in different realizations of the entire flow field, the data can be post-processed to provide valuable insight into the mechanics of the turbulence model and the regions of the flow field that contribute to the resulting uncertainties.
Figure \ref{fig:mach_isosurface} depicts iso-surfaces of areas where the local Mach number varies by greater than $0.2$ across all the perturbed simulations.
This Mach variability $(M_v)$ is defined at every point in the computational domain as $M_v = max(M_i) - min(M_i)$ where $i$ refers to each realization of the flow field ($5$ perturbed + $1$ baseline flow fields) and $M_i$ represents the Mach number at each point in that flow field. 

At low angles of attack, Figure \ref{fig:01aoa}, the Mach variability is low and limited to small regions in the flow field.
The small regions indicate that the eigenspace perturbations do not cause significant changes in the flow, resulting in smaller uncertainty bounds.
As the angle of attack increases, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:02aoa} and \ref{fig:03aoa}, larger areas of variability appear where the shock is expected: at the upper surface of the wing and away from the leading edge.
These regions denote an uncertainty in the shock location.
This area grows rapidly until it reaches the leading edge in Figure \ref{fig:04aoa}, signaling large uncertainty estimates and reduced confidence in the CFD predictions.
Such visualizations allow us to analyze the relationship between the dominant flow features and their role in introducing uncertainty in the turbulence models.

Similarly, the variability in any other flow quantity can be analyzed.
Knowing which areas contribute to the uncertainty in performance predictions can aid design decisions.
These results can inform sensor placement when moving to experimental campaigns.
For example, a higher density of pressure sensors can be used in areas with large variability in the pressure coefficient ($C_P$).
Flow visualization techniques can be focused on areas with large velocity variability.
From the perspective of turbulence modeling, these variability visualizations can shed light on the types of flow features that are hard to predict using RANS simulations.
This additional data processing provides more qualitative applications for the RANS UQ methodology.
