\section{Databases for the Generic T-tail Transport Aircraft} \label{sec:gtt_dbs}

Thus far, the examples of probabilistic databases has been focused on the baseline aerodynamics of the aircrafts in question. 
This section will focus on controls databases which define the aircrafts response to a control surface deflection by providing the resulting rotational moments that are imparted. 
As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:gtt_cfd_data_gen}, the difficulty in modeling control surface deflections precludes the use of CFD simulation data in building these controls databases. 
Consequently, these databases can be, at most, two-fidelity ones with AVL simulations and wind tunnel experiments as the data sources. 

With controls databases, an additional dimension of control surface deflection angle is introduced.

Since aerodynamic databases have already been showcased in Section \ref{sec:mf_gp_nasa_crm}, illustrations in this section will focus on controls databases.
