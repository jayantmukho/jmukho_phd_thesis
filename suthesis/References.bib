    abstract = {SNOWPAC (Stochastic Nonlinear Optimization With Path-Augmented Constraints) is a method for stochastic nonlinear constrained derivative-free optimization. For such problems, it extends the path-augmented constraints framework introduced by the deterministic optimization method NOWPAC and uses a noise-adapted trust region approach and Gaussian processes for noise reduction. In recent developments, SNOWPAC is available in the DAKOTA framework which oﬀers a highly ﬂexible interface to couple the optimizer with diﬀerent sampling strategies or surrogate models. In this paper we discuss details of SNOWPAC and demonstrate the coupling with DAKOTA. We showcase the approach by presenting design optimization results of a shape in a 2D supersonic duct. This simulation is supposed to imitate the behavior of the ﬂow in a SCRAMJET simulation but at a much lower computational cost. Additionally diﬀerent mesh or model ﬁdelities can be tested. Thus, it serves as a convenient test case before moving to costly SCRAMJET computations. Here, we study deterministic results and results obtained by introducing uncertainty on inﬂow parameters. As sampling strategies we compare classical Monte Carlo sampling with multilevel Monte Carlo approaches for which we developed new error estimators. All approaches show a reasonable optimization of the design over the objective while maintaining or seeking feasibility. Furthermore, we achieve signiﬁcant reductions in computational cost by using multilevel approaches that combine solutions from diﬀerent grid resolutions.},

    abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These diﬀerent models have varying evaluation costs and varying ﬁdelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-ﬁdelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-ﬁdelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-ﬁdelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation, require multiple model evaluations at many diﬀerent inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-ﬁdelity model is used. This work surveys multiﬁdelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-ﬁdelity and low-ﬁdelity model evaluations, where the low-ﬁdelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-ﬁdelity model (e.g., a simpliﬁed physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-ﬁt surrogate, etc.) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-ﬁdelity model. The overall premise of these multiﬁdelity methods is that low-ﬁdelity models are leveraged for speedup while the high-ﬁdelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multiﬁdelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and ﬁltering. The paper reviews multiﬁdelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

In this paper, an enhanced cokriging based sequential optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the impact of considering full correlation of data among all models on the hyper-parameter estimation during cokriging modeling is investigated by setting up a unified maximum likelihood function. Then, to reduce the computational cost, an extended expected improvement function is established to more reasonably identify the location and fidelity level of the next response evaluation based on the original expected improvement criterion. The results from comparative studies and one airfoil aerodynamic optimization application show that the proposed cokriging based sequential optimization method is more accurate in modeling and efficient in model evaluation than some existing popular approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and relative merits.},

Variable-ﬁdelity metamodeling is a way to improve the prediction of the output of a complex system by incorporating rapidly available auxiliary lower-ﬁdelity data. This work uses two ﬁdelity levels, but more levels can be added. The LATIN iterative algorithm is used along with a “multiparametric” strategy to calculate the various data and their different ﬁdelity levels by means of an error indicator. Three main categories of variable-ﬁdelity strategies are currently available. We tested at least one method from each of these categories, which comes to a total of ﬁve methods for calculating a valid metamodel using low- and high-ﬁdelity data. Here, our objective is to compare the performances of these ﬁve methods in solving three mechanical examples.},

    abstract = {Designing and optimizing complex systems generally requires the use of numerical models. However, it is often too expensive to evaluate these models at each step of an optimization problem. Instead surrogate models can be used to explore the design space, as they are much cheaper to evaluate. Constructing a surrogate becomes challenging when different numerical models are used to compute the same quantity, but with different levels of fidelity (i.e., different levels of uncertainty in the models). In this work, we propose a method based on statistical techniques to build such a multi-fidelity surrogate. We introduce a new definition of fidelity in the form of a variance metric. This variance is characterized by expert opinion and can vary across the design space. Gaussian processes are used to create an intermediate surrogate for each model. The uncertainty of each intermediate surrogate is then characterized by a total variance, combining the posterior variance of the Gaussian process and the fidelity variance. Finally, a single multifidelity surrogate is constructed by fusing all the intermediate surrogates. One of the advantages of the approach is the multi-fidelity surrogate capability of integrating models whose fidelity changes over the design space, thus relaxing the common assumption of hierarchical relationships among models.},

    abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the ﬁeld of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to ﬁt response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efﬁcient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

    abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of fusing several random variables (RV’s) with unknown correlations. A family of upper bounds on the resulting covariance matrix is given, and is shown to contain the upper bound offered by the Covariance Intersection (CI) Algorithm proposed by Julier and Uhlmann. For trace minimization, the optimal one in this family is better than the one obtained by CI except in some cases where they are equal. It is further proved that the best pair of combination gains that minimizes the above optimal-trace-in-the-family coincides with the one associated with the best value of omega in CI. Thus the CI Algorithm provides a convenient one-dimensional parameterization for the optimal solution in the n-square dimensional space. The results are also extended to multiple RV’s and partial estimates.},

One way to specify a covariance structure for a set of random variables de ned at each point on a product space is by a Kronecker product form. Then the speci cation requires only a covariance structure on each of the component spaces. This note proves that a simple Markov-like assumption on the random variables implies that their covariance structure must, apart from an arbitrary scaling, follow a Kronecker product form. When a more restricted version of the Markov property is assumed, an autoregressive or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck form arises.},
