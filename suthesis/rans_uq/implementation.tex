\section{Implementation in SU2}

SU2 is an open-source software suite used to solve non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDE) along with PDE-constrained optimization problems while utilizing unstructured meshes \cite{su21}.
The framework is general and meant to be extensible to any governing equations for multi-physics problems.
This work focuses on its Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver capable of simulating compressible, turbulent flows found in aerospace engineering and design problems.
Extensive validation studies of the SU2 platform conducted across a diverse assortment of turbulent flows \cite{su22} ensures the solver's reliability.

SU2 is actively developed around the world.
It has been released under an open-source license and is freely available to the community so that developers may contribute to the source code and further improve the accuracy and capabilities of the suite.
To accomplish ease of use, the SU2 includes industry-standard solver technology for turbulent flows while also developing numerical solution algorithms that result in robust convergence rates.
Finally, to aid with gradient-based optimization, SU2 includes a discrete adjoint solver implementation for efficiently computing the gradient of any quantity of interest with respect to any design variable.

This section outlines details of implementing the eigenspace perturbation methodology into the CFD solver.
The first part of the discussion outlines the algorithms and the steps required to perform the eigenspace perturbation within the CFD solver.
The second part focuses on its implementation via computer code and its integration with the SU2 solver.

Fig. \ref{fig:equips_overview} shows where the eigenspace perturbation fits within the context of the CFD solver.
SU2 carries out the perturbation for each cell of the grid at each pseudo-time step.
This process repeats until the flow simulation converges and outputs a perturbed solution.

Fig. \ref{fig:perturbation_schematic} focuses on the steps required to perform the eigenspace perturbation.
The first step is to use the flow field to calculate the Reynolds stress tensor, using Equation \ref{equ:rst}, at each cell in the computational domain.
The anisotropic part of the tensor, $b_{ij}$ in Equation \ref{equ:rst_decomp}, is decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as shown in Equation \ref{equ:eigendecomposition}.
The decomposition is done efficiently by leveraging the anisotropic tensor's symmetry.
First, the symmetric tensor is reduced to a symmetric tridiagonal form using the Householder's transform and accumulating orthogonal similarity transformations.
This step uses the TRED2 procedure outlined by \cite{tred2a}.
\cite{numres} presents the details of the routine.
Then, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this symmetric tridiagonal matrix are computed and sorted using the TQL2 procedure outlined in \cite{tred2b}.
These two steps provide a complete eigendecomposition of the Reynolds stress tensor at a cell in the domain.

The eigenvalues are used to project the stress state onto the barycentric anisotropy invariant map using Equation \ref{equ:barycentric_mapping}.
According to the type of perturbation, the stress state, denoted by the coordinates $\mathbf{x}$, is perturbed towards one of the vertices of the barycentric map.
An under-relaxation factor ensures solution stability.
For example, if the stress state is perturbed towards the 1-component state, the perturbed stress state is represented by the coordinates, 
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{x^*} = \mathbf{x} + r\left ( \mathbf{x}_{1C} - \mathbf{x} \right )
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the under-relaxation factor.
$r$ is a user-tunable parameter. 
All the results shown in this thesis use the default value of $r=0.1$.

Using the barycentric coordinates of the perturbed stress tensor, $\mathbf{x^*}$, Equation \ref{equ:barycentric_mapping} is refactored to get the perturbed eigenvalues.
This results in 2 equations, one for each coordinate, with three unknown eigenvalues.
The fact that the anisotropy tensor has a zero trace i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 0
\end{equation}
provides the third equation required to solve the system of equations for the perturbed eigenvalues.

Similarly, for the eigenvector perturbation, the eigenvectors of the Reynolds stress tensor at a cell are permuted to $v_{min}$ or $v_{max}$, depending on the specific perturbation.
The Reynolds stress tensor at each cell is reconstructed using these perturbed eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Additionally, dependent quantities like the turbulence production tensor are re-constituted using this perturbed Reynolds stress tensor.
These are input back into the CFD solver for the next iteration.
This process continues till numerical convergence as determined by the convergence criteria. 

SU2's modular architecture enables integrating this framework without significant alterations to the main code.
The module is split into two parts: a high-level Python script that sequentially specifies the type of perturbation and C++ code that performs the perturbations during the execution of simulations.
For smooth operation, it is best to have performed a baseline simulation with SU2 and have achieved sufficient convergence.
It ensures that the mesh file and the input configuration file are well-posed and can provide converged perturbed solutions if run through the Python script.

The Python script takes an input configuration file and a mesh file identical to the ones used to run the baseline CFD simulation in SU2.
The script sets the necessary configuration options to run the EQUiPS framework.
These include the direction of the eigenvalue perturbation (aligned towards one of the $1C, 2C$ or $3C$ state on the barycentric triangle for a specific simulation), the magnitude of the eigenvalue perturbation ($\Delta_{B} \in [0,1]$) and the perturbed alignment of the Reynolds stress eigenvector ($v_{min}$ or $v_{max}$, as detailed earlier in this section).
It sequentially runs through the simulations for each perturbed state, creating a new directory for each new simulation, and outputting the results in the respective directories.
In conjunction with the converged baseline solution, these results can be post-processed to provide the necessary model-form uncertainty information. 

The implementation within the existing code base is limited to the two areas where the perturbations are injected into the simulation: the viscous and turbulent flux calculations.
The perturbed stress tensors replace the original ones in the flux calculations.
The new fluxes advance each node to the next pseudo-timestep.
In the SST turbulence model, \cite{sst}, the effects of the perturbations manifest themselves in the turbulence production term. 

As the solution converges, the Reynolds Stress also converges to its perturbed state.
Once a perturbed solution is converged, the Python script moves on to the next eigenspace perturbation.
It creates a new directory and configuration file to specify the new perturbation options.
This process continues until all the specified perturbed simulations are complete. 

In the spirit of \textit{versatility}, the implementation was designed to minimize the number of user-defined inputs.
The implementation allows the use of the framework without in-depth knowledge of its mechanics.
The details of the perturbations (componentiality, eigenvector permutation) are abstracted away to provide a clean user interface that does not deviate from the workflow of running regular CFD simulations. All the options used for the module can also be specified in the configuration file for the potential expert user without needing the Python script.
